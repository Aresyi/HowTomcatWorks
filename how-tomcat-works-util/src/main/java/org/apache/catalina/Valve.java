 * <p>A <b>Valve</b> is a request processing component associated with a

     * <p>Perform request processing as required by this Valve.</p>
     *
     * <p>An individual Valve <b>MAY</b> perform the following actions, in
     * the specified order:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Examine and/or modify the properties of the specified Request and
     *     Response.
     * <li>Examine the properties of the specified Request, completely generate
     *     the corresponding Response, and return control to the caller.
     * <li>Examine the properties of the specified Request and Response, wrap
     *     either or both of these objects to supplement their functionality,
     *     and pass them on.
     * <li>If the corresponding Response was not generated (and control was not
     *     returned, call the next Valve in the pipeline (if there is one) by
     *     executing <code>context.invokeNext()</code>.
     * <li>Examine, but not modify, the properties of the resulting Response
     *     (which was created by a subsequently invoked Valve or Container).
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A Valve <b>MUST NOT</b> do any of the following things:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Change request properties that have already been used to direct
     *     the flow of processing control for this request (for instance,
     *     trying to change the virtual host to which a Request should be
     *     sent from a pipeline attached to a Host or Context in the
     *     standard implementation).
     * <li>Create a completed Response <strong>AND</strong> pass this
     *     Request and Response on to the next Valve in the pipeline.
     * <li>Consume bytes from the input stream associated with the Request,
     *     unless it is completely generating the response, or wrapping the
     *     request before passing it on.
     * <li>Modify the HTTP headers included with the Response after the
     *     <code>invokeNext()</code> method has returned.
     * <li>Perform any actions on the output stream associated with the
     *     specified Response after the <code>invokeNext()</code> method has
     *     returned.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param request The servlet request to be processed
     * @param response The servlet response to be created
     * @param context The valve context used to invoke the next valve
     *  in the current processing pipeline
     *
     * @exception IOException if an input/output error occurs, or is thrown
     *  by a subsequently invoked Valve, Filter, or Servlet
     * @exception ServletException if a servlet error occurs, or is thrown
     *  by a subsequently invoked Valve, Filter, or Servlet

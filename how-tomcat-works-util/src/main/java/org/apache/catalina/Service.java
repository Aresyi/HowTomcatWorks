 * A <strong>Service</strong> is a group of one or more
 * <strong>Connectors</strong> that share a single <strong>Container</strong>
 * to process their incoming requests.  This arrangement allows, for example,
 * a non-SSL and SSL connector to share the same population of web apps.
 * <p>
 * A given JVM can contain any number of Service instances; however, they are
 * completely independent of each other and share only the basic JVM facilities
 * and classes on the system class path.
